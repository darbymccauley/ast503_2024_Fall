Necessarily, you'll have to compare the rest-frame flux with the observer frame flux further in the red at some redshift $z$ because the Universe is expanding and frequency of photons is shifting. \n",

    "As we discussed in class (or as you might know if you've listened to a talk from Prof. Joaquin Vieira) galaxies have an interesting effect where the flux density $F_\\nu$ from about 250$\\mu m$ becomes roughly constant over a large range in redshift because you climb the Rayleigh-Jeans tail as you increase redshift, which compensates for the decrease in the flux density because of increasing distance. In the optical, you have no such luck, and indeed, depending on the class of galaxy, the $k$-correction means that galaxies in a fixed observer band might seem even fainter than you might expect from the inverse square law. \n",

The Hogg et al. 2002 will need you to specify a rest-frame filter for each of the observer frame filters. Use the same LSST ugrizy filter set and determine which one is at the closest effective wavelength to the observer frame filter's effective wavelength at each redshift. If there is no band that maps well to an observer frame band (i.e. the the rest-frame filter has redshifted out of the observer frame filter) stop computing the $k$-correction for that filter. \n",

    "For this simulation, we will generate a sample of type Ia supernovae. These are special as they have similar intrinsic brightness, so that their apparent flux can be used to measure how far away they are. If their redshift is also measured, the measurements can be used to calculate the expansion rate of the Universe, or Hubble's constant.\n",

Sources > 21 are detected with 0% efficiency. This is obviously unrealistic, but it'll suffice for now.\n",

In the data generation part of the simulation, assume that each supernova is receding at a rate v=H0*d, where H0 is 72km/s/Mpc and d is the distance in Mpc. For each supernova you simulate, also create a peculiar velocity array that you can add to the recession velocity by drawing from a Gaussian distribution with mean 0, and standard deviation of 600 km/s. (Hint: \"uniformly in a sphere\" is definitely a trap and you should think about what you are doing)\n",

Calculate the apparent magnitude of each supernovae using the distance generated in part (1). If m>21, assume the object is too faint to detect and reject it from the sample. Create a plot of magnitude versus distance for all the supernovae. Write out the *average* magnitudes of the original sample and the detected sample. \n",

Generate an observed distance ($d'$) by using its apparent magnitude and Hubble’s law, with the *assumption* that the supernova has an absolute magnitude (M) of -19. Plot the observed distance on the x-axis and total velocity on the y-axis and compare it to the true distance. Explain the effect of the observing limit on the resulting sample. \n",

    "4. Calculate $H_0$ by fitting a line to all your detected points. Discuss the level of the bias from the fit you get to the true points. How much of an impact does the peculiar velocity have? How could you account for Malmquist bias and peculiar velocity in the observations? Repeat for N=1000, 10000 SNe (and as with Q1, make your code use approrpiate functions so you can just call it for different sample sizes) to see if the effects persist as a function of sample size.
